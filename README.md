## BcashBot
Open Source code for /u/BcashBot on reddit. 

You can find more information about the bot on it's [info page](https://www.reddit.com/user/BcashBot/comments/98wot8/what_is_this_bot/).
### EDIT:
You still need to add a file 'comment_text.txt' for the bot to work. Github doesn't allow to upload empty files.

Have fun! ;)
